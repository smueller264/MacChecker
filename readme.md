## General Information

I ordered a standard config MacBook Pro and the delivery date was so late, that i created a script to check all Apple Stores in Germany if my MacBook was available for Pickup. I also implemented a Telegram Bot to message me if my config is available, so i can upload the script to AWS and create a lambda function to run every 15 min.
